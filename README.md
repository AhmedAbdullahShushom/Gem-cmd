# Gem-cmd
Very simple minimalistic Python code to run Gemini AI response from the command prompt.
Install the necessary library by typing 
 ``pip install google-generativeai``
In your terminal or CMD.
In the Python file, line 12, put your own AI key in.
Put the *.bat* and *.py* files in your admin folder or whatever terminal you're running your command prompt from.
